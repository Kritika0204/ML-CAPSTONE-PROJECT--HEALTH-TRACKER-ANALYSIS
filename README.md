# ML-CAPSTONE-PROJECT--HEALTH-TRACKER-ANALYSIS
Introduction :
The Medication Effectiveness Dataset hosted on Kaggle provides valuable insights into medication effectiveness across various parameters. This dataset serves as a comprehensive resource for exploring the effectiveness of different medications, factors influencing their efficacy, and related attributes. It's curated to support projects focusing on machine learning, specifically in the domain of medication effectiveness analysis.

Business Problem Statement
The objective is to enhance a decision-support system that predicts the effectiveness of medications based on patient profiles. By incorporating demographic information, medical history, and allergies, the goal is to aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about prescriptions, thereby improving patient outcomes and minimizing adverse drug reactions.
